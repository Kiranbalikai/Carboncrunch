## Approach
My development approach was a top-to-bottom build. I started by creating the Navbar, followed by the main landing section. I divided the  content into four main sections: main screen, Cards, Services, Features. I completed each section one by one, focusing on layout, styling, and fonts.

Once the structure and styling were complete, I added animations and effects, referencing resources from YouTube, Google, and AI tools. For fonts, I used Google Fonts to import external styles. Since I couldn't find the Aeonik TRIAL font readily available online, I added it manually.

There might be minor margin or padding inconsistencies across different screen sizes, but these are small adjustments that can be easily fixed.
